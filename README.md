# CR-10-BL-Touch-Marlin

This is the marlin version that finally worked on my CR-10 modified from one of crealities default firmware. 
The code in it of itself is pretty much just some simple configuration updates, but it was the only thing that would actually work.

# Hardware Setup

I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0821314T9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> this sensor </a> (3D Touch Smart - A simple BL-Touch clone), and I wired the yellow wire (Servo Pin) up to pin 27 on my original creality mainboard, which entailed snipping a wire going to the LCD panel designated for the buzzer, and resoldering it to the servo wire.
